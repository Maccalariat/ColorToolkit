ProfileInformation.mlapp
    Add in CIELab reference triangle:
        opened gamut RGB reference overlayed with Adobe, sRGB
        Pointer's gamut an optional extra

myColorCloud function:
    improve performance

generatePointersGamut.m
    figure out how I want this to function: produce and image and in what
    colorspace.
    This should be an alternative for the reference gamut.
    Where can I get an authoritative profile/data set of this?

generateReferenceGamut.m
    Possibly refactor this and generatePointersGamut.m to produce the
    'reference' gamut of choice:
    a) all colors with variable saturation
    b) Pointer's gamut
    c) a macbeth/colorchecker. Only useful if it has a lot of swatches.
